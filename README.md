# 👋 Gaurav Singh

**Backend-focused Ruby on Rails Engineer** with 2+ years of real-world experience building, deploying, and maintaining production SaaS applications.

I work close to the metal — APIs, databases, background jobs, deployments, and production debugging.  
No tutorial fluff. No buzzword padding. Just systems that work.

- Deploy containerized applications using **Docker on AWS EC2**
